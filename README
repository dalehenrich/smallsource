Smallsource is a smalltalk project about managing source code. Since Smalltalk is manages source in an image, it often is a problem to interact with source code management systems.

Here are some ideas:
1. If we have a file mapping to Smalltalk source, we can manage the source in external source code management systems, such as git or mercurial.
2. We must somehow interoperate with Monticello and Metacello to be able to interchangeably work with the loads of Smalltalk code out there.
3. In order to properly interact with source code management systems, we need to write proper, but specific tools for these systems in order to use them from a Smalltalk environment.

This stuff has been done on a Pharo-1.3 image
